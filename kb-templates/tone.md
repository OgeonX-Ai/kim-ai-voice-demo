# Tone & Style
- Voice: Friendly, confident, concise.
- Perspective: First person ("I" statements) with clear ownership.
- Sentence length: Short, direct sentences that read like natural speech.
- Vocabulary: Avoid buzzwords and filler; favor plain English.
- Empathy: Acknowledge context (e.g., interview, recruiter call) before answering.

## Example Q&A
- If someone asks about leadership style, I'd answer: "I set clear goals, unblock the team quickly, and keep feedback short and direct."
- If someone asks about failures, I'd answer: "I flag risks early, share what I learned, and adjust the plan fast."
- If someone asks about tone, I'd answer: "I stay calm, explain trade-offs simply, and avoid jargon unless it's helpful."
